TODO:

- Disable interactivity when authenticating.
- Admin and Student logs.
- Admin monitoring.
- Maybe Student COR upload for double checking of Student Number.
- Seamless integration of charts.
- Frontend.

There are 3 modules for computation for the students.

- Grades - 25%
  - Calculation for the grades:
    - a = 50%
    - b = 30%
    - c = 20%
- Certificates - 25%
  - Calculation for certificates:
    - a = 3
    - b = 2
    - c = 1
  - If the student has taken the certificate needed for the Job, it will be automatically placed in the result.
- Internship - 50%
  - Calculation for internship:
    - Grade = 33.33%
    - Tasks = 33.33%, if there's no task performed by the student, this will result to 0, else 100.
    - Type of Company = 33.33%, If not IT Company the result will be 0, else 100.

These 3 modules will have a breakdown of the Jobs well suited for the students.
